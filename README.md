Hanglady_Game
=============

Hang-Lady was a personal project created for fun in order to get to know aspects of programming that my 
compiler project didn't touch on as much: 

JavaScript, JQuery, interacting with DOM, functional programming, HTML/CSS, and photoshop.

This JS game (mimicking Hangman rules but spreading gender equality in the efforts) has options to choose a word for your friend to guess or randomize a word from Victorian-era books.
You can also pick how many chances you want to allow yourself to choose the wrong letter (between 5 and 7).
Given that information, the story and images personalize to that experience, and the game commences.

As you play, the letters in the guessing box show up bolded and green if guessed correctly, or red with strikethrough
if guessed incorrectly (the bold and strikethrough made possible for ADA functionality and consideration of 
colorblindness, etc.), and the word guessed thus far changes in the center.
